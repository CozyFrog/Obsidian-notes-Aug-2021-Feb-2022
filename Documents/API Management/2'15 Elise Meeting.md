## Project: Slatwall API Management
### New Endpoint Tasks
* Put tasks into sprint lists, put sprints/tasks into Float

* Updating public documentation
	* Do it on QA Tests/Elise collection (in Team Workspace) (second from the bottom)

## Public Service Endpoints Spreadsheet
* Top 8 or so are private endpoints, rest should be public.
	* except for ones that are commented.
* No "Add Template Order Item" - just add request, update title, type, edit URL ("/addOrderTemplateItem")
	* Have to add body, make it up based on the response.

Start with things like order template, wishlist, stuff that's newer.
Probably don't need AjaxResponse.
Stuff like getOrderTemplates, getOrderTemplateDetails.
Stuff that accounts on the front end should be able to do - cancel order template, update order template schedule, etc.

# How to track progress?
* Put in notes field.
* Maybe make subtasks on the Postman Public Documentation Updates task
* Start wishlist, product, order template, anything that looks like I understand.
	* Accounts/orders probably won't have anything new.
* Anything highlighted is nothing to worry about.

## Meetings
* Could set up meetings with Tom.

Sprints are tuesday to tuesday.
Adding new endpoints to collection, have to add a task to teamwork to write tests.

Make own fork off of QA Test/Elise's (1.4) for documentation stuff. Can leave branch/fork open for as long as I need.
