## Folding
* foldr: fold from left to right
	* start at f(x_n, e), end at f(x_1,...)
* foldl: fold from right to left
	* start at f(x_1,e), end at f(x_n,...)

Code:
~~~
fun foldr f e nil = e
  | foldr f e (a::b) = f a (foldr f e b);

fun foldl f e nil = e
  | foldl f e (a::b) = f (foldl f a e) b;
~~~

* Concat:
	* foldl is reversed, foldr is regular.

* Exercise:
	* How to find the minimum or maximum value of a list with foldl or foldr?
		* e = x_1, but how do we actually do this?
		* what is f?
			* >,< will give boolean values. write your own max(a,b) function.
~~~
fun max a b = if a > b then a else b;
fun min a b = if a < b then a else b;

fun minl (x::xs) = foldr min x xs; // pattern match (x::xs) so we can pass x_1 as e
// if you give an empty list, it will break.
// if you're nice, add exception to handle this
fun maxl (x::xs) = foldr max x xs;
~~~

## Other Higher Order Functions

* map takes function f and a list. that f, for example, is to convert a character into uppercase.
	* if it's empty, output is empty.
	* if not, we apply f to the head (parentheses!) then cons (list construction) the tail.
	* make sure order is correct ((f a) should be the head.
	* toUpper != Char.toUpper (namespace)
		* map only works on lists, so we have to explode s

* fun extend x l = map (fn y => (x,y)) l;	
	* function: (fn y => (x,y))
		* takes y, creates pair (x,y)
	* output of extend
	* extend 1 \[1, 2, 3\]
		* = \[(1,1), (1,2), (1,3)\]

### Filter
* Filtering a list:
	* Takes a predicate function p (returns true or false)
		* p: 'a -> bool
	* Takes a list of 'a
	* Returns a list of 'a that satisfies p

* fun threePlusOne n = if n mod 2 = 0 then n div 2 else 3\*n + 1;
~~~
fun fillList f n = if n < 0 then [] else
	let
		val v = f n
	in
		if v<>1 then v::(fillList f v) else [1] (*v<>1 means v != 1*)
	end;
