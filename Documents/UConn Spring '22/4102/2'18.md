fn()=> map f (xf())
need the arrow function – takes unit, produces sequence

## interleave
~~~
(* Function interleave creates a sequence from two sequences *)
(* The items in this sequence are picked alternatively from the two sequences *)

fun interleave (Empty, yq) = yq
	|interleave (Cons(x, xf), yq) = 
		Cons(x, fn()=>interleave(yq,xf()));
~~~

# HIGHER ORDER
* can we use filter?


## Example
~~~
map, from, head, tail, take

(* Given infinite sequences xq an yq, consider forming the sequence of all pairs (x,y) with x from xq and y from yq *)

fun pair x y = (x, y);

(* A sequence of sequences is generated using makeqq *)
fun makeqq (xq, yq) = map (fn x=> map (pair x) yq) xq;
~~~
makeqq – first sequence is x=1 paired with every element of yq, next sequence is x=2 paired w/ every element of yq, etc.

~~~
fun interleave (Empty, yq) = yq
	|interleave (Cons(x, xf), yq) = 
		Cons(x, fn()=>interleave(yq,xf()));

(* Enumerate creates a sequence from a sequence of sequences *)
fun enumerate Empty = Empty
	|enumerate (Cons(Empty, xqf)) = enumerate (xqf())
	|enumerate (Cons(Cons(x,xf), xqf)) = 
		Cons(x, fn()=>interleave(enumerate (xqf())), xf()));
