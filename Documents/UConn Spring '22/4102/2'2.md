### my version:
~~~
fun scale (a: real) [] = []
  | scale (a: real) (x::y) = a*x :: scale a, y ;
  
~~~

### wei's version:
~~~
fun scale a [] = []
  | scale a x::xs = a*x :: scale a xs;

// this is a curried function
val a = scale 2.0 [1.0, 2.0, 3.0];
print_list a;

## Functional Structures
* Create new structure when the old and new differ
* Share what is untouched

### Error Handling
* addTree code must deal with incorrect input.
	* Example: attempt to add two pairs with the same key.
* Usual solution
	* Exceptions
		* Change the standard control flow
		* Exceptions are raised when error is detected
		* Exceptions are handled at the appropriate call site

~~~
exception AlreadyPresent;
fun addTree e Leaf = Node(e, Leaf, Leaf)
  | addTree e (Node(v, l, r)) = if (e < v)
  								then Node(v, addTree e l, r)
								else if (e < v)
									then Node(v, l, addTree e r)
									else raise AlreadyPresent;
handle AlreadyPresent
	=> (print "Attempt to add an element twice\n";Leaf);

postorder traversal - left subtree, right subtree, parent

## Symbolic Expression
* Need a Data type for the expression
	* One constructor for constant, for variables, and for each arithmetic operator.
* Need a way to associate values with variables
	* Store
