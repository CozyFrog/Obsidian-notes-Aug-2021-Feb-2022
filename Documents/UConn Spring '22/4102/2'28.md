### Exam Format
#### First Part:
* Coding
	* FOLDING!
	* In each problem, there won't be just one function but multiple steps.
	* Two problems:
		* One related to list.
		* One related to stream/sequence.
	* Code on your own machine.
	* Use sml (it lets you see what you're doing as you go, instead of printing after you compile). 

* Should spend time
	* Reading code
	* Doing code for thought
	* Review slides

* All things that we need will be given in template code
* No Lambda calculus

Take a few minutes to review something here and there.


## Lambda Calculus (Cont.)
#### Addition
* Successor 0
~~~
a(0ab) -> (a applied to b zero times is b) ==
L ab.a(b) -> L sz.s(z) == 1
~~~

#### Multiplication
* 3\*3
* think about b as 0 and a as successor (so this equals 9).
