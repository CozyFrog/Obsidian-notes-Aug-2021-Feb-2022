Remember "orelse" and "andalso"

Most difficult hw prob: has kind of nested structure
~~~
fun disjoint xs ys = all (fn x => all (fn y => x<>y) ys) xs;

val all = fn : ('a -> bool) -> 'a list -> bool

# working on tree instead of linear collection like list

# Infinite Data Structures
### (Streams or Sequences, but prefer "Sequences")
* First issue: representing a stream.
* SOLUTION:
	* Use a data type with two constructors.
		* One for the empty stream.
		* One to build a stream out of
			* a root element, and
			* a higher order function that will build the tail on demand.
	* Provide functions to seed the stream, pick up its first element, and pick up a leading sub seuence.

## Sequences
~~~
datatype 'a S = Empty
			  | Cons of 'a * (unit-> 'a S);

exception Error;
# n is the "next" function
fun from s n = Cons(s,fn()=>from (n s) n);

# seed function is (fn x => x+1);
val z = from  (fn x => x+1);
~~~

### Picking up the Tail
~~~
fun head Empty = raise Error
	| head (Cons(a,b)) = a;
	fun tail Empty = raise Error
		| tail(Cons(a,b)) = b();
~~~

### Find a prefix of length *n*
~~~
fun take n Empty = raise Error
	| take 0 l = nil
	| take n (Cons(a,b)) = a::(take (n-1) (b()));
