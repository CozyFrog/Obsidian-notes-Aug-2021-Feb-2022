# Structure
- Syntax:
~~~
structure <Identifier> = 
struct
	<declarations>
end;
~~~
* Offers a namespace
### Example
~~~
structure Stack = 
struct
	exception EmptyStack;
	val empty = nil;
	fun push x s = (x::s);
	fun top nil = raise EmptyStack
	  | top (x::s) = x;
	fun pop nil = raise EmptyStack
	  | pop (x::s) = s;
end;
~~~

# Signatures
* A signature is a specification of the names and types that a structure should support if it wants to implement the interface.
* A signature is the <i>type</i> of the structure.
### Example
~~~
signature StackSig = 
sig
	exception EmptyStack;
	val empty : 'a list;
	Fun push : 'a -> 'a list -> 'a list;    # 'a is the general type (alpha)
											# curried version - star == not curried
	fun top : 'a list -> 'a;                # just value
	fun pop : 'a list -> 'a list;           # value and updated list
end;
~~~
  
### Abstract Type in signature
~~~
signature StackSig = 
sig
	exception EmptyStack;
	type 'a Stack;
	val empty : 'a Stack;
	Fun push : 'a -> 'a Stack -> 'a Stack;    # 'a is the general type (alpha)
											# curried version - star == not curried
	fun top : 'a Stack -> 'a;                # just value
	fun pop : 'a Stack -> 'a Stack;           # value and updated Stack
end;
structure Stack = struct
	exception EmptyStack;
	type 'a Stack = 'a list;
	val empty = nil;
	fun push x s = (x::s);
	fun top nil = raise EmptyStack
	  | top (x::s) = x;
	fun pop nil = raise EmptyStack
	  | pop (x::s) = s;
end;
~~~

# Functors
* Look like functions over structures.
* Take structures as an argument, product structure as output.
* The output is a specialized structure.

## Heap Code
~~~
datatype 'a TRee = Leaf
	| Node of 'a * a' Tree * 'a Tree;

  | insert(w:real, Node(v, t1, t2)) =

	else Node(v, insert(w, t2), t1);
~~~

~~~

  | leftrem (Node(v,t1,t2)) = 
		let
			val (w, t) = leftrem t1
		in
			(w, Node(v,t2,t))
		end;
~~~

~~~
fun siftdown (w:real, Leaf, Leaf) = Node(w, Leaf, Leaf) 
  | siftdown (w, t as Node(v, Leaf, Leaf), Leaf) = #t is left subtree
		if w<=v then Node(w, t, Leaf)

~~~

~~~
# delete minimum
# we're deleting the leftmost element

~~~

~~~
