## Cryptography
* Basic crypto mechanisms:
	* Symmetric/shared-key encryption
	* Public key encryption
	* Digital signatures
	* Hashing

### Cryptology $\approx$ Cryptography
* Cryptology: 'Science of secret information'.
	* Protecting secrets: encryption
	* Using secrets: keys
* Main tool for cyber security
* Using limitations of adversasy to
	* Prevent damage - e.g. encrypt for privacy
	* Punish, deter corruption - e.g. use signatures
	* Which limitations? Computational + knowledge

### Encryption
* Prevention of exposure of secret information
* Ealiest and 'basic' tool of cryptology
* Related terms:
	* Cryptography: 'secret writing'
	* Cryptanalysis: 'breaking' encryption
	* Encryption scheme = Cryptosystem = Cypher

#### Basic terms:
* Goal: encrypt plaintext into ciphertext
* Only legit-recipient can decrypt ciphertext to plaintext
	* Adversary cannot learn anything from ciphertext
* Idea: decryption uses secret (algorithm and/or) key
* Variants:
	* Shared key (symmetric) or public/private keys (asymmetric)?

#### Example: One-Time-Pad (OTP)
* Encrypt by XORing message with key:
	* Ciphertext = Plaintext xor Key
	* XOR: 0 xor 0  = 1 xor 1 = 0; 0 xor 1 = 1 xor 0 = 1
	* Bit by bit XOR: 1101 xor 1000 = 0101
* Decrypt to XORing ciphertext with key:
	* Ciphertext xor Key = (Plaintext xor Key) xor Key =
	* Plaintext xor (Key xor Key) =
	* Plaintext
	* Efficent, simple, and provable secure
	* Remember, key must be as long as cipher text

### Standard Block Ciphers (symmetric)
* Block Cipher: 'encrypt' one block of plaintext
* Use Cipher-Block-Chaining (CBC) or other 'mode' for longer inputs
	* Data Encryption Standard (DES): 64-bit blocks, 56 bit keys
	* Advanced Encryption Standard (AES): 128-bit blocks, 128/192/256 bit keys

### Public Key Cryptosystem (PKC)
![[Screen Shot 2022-02-23 at 8.29.21 AM.png]]
* Encryption key e is public
* Decryption key d is private (and different: e $\neq$ d)
	* Not exposed from public key e
* \[DH76\] only presented the concept of public key encryption, and a design for 'key exchange protocol'

### But public key crypto is harder...
* Requires related public, private kys
	* Private key 'reverses' public key
	* Public key does not expose private key
* Substantial overhead
	* Need long keys (cf. shared key!)
	* Complex computations:
		* RSA: ~10MD/sec, AES:~5GB/sec!
	* RSA: complex (slow) key generation
	* In practice, use 'hybrid encryption':
		* Use PKC to encrypt a shared key, encrypt the data

### Digital Signature (Concept: DH76)
* Use private key s to compute signature
* And publish public verification key v != s
* I can sign, everybody can verify - but not forge!

### Public Key Signatures
* Sign with private key s, verify with public key v

* Key-generation (KG): generates the key-pair
	* Unforgeability: given v, attacker should be unable to find 'valid' (m, $\sigma$ ) i.e., $V_v(m,\sigma) = OK$
* First published design: RSA'77

### The Hash-then-Sign Paradigm
* Challenge: messages are long, PKC is slow
* How to sign long messages efficiently?
	* Idea: use Collision-Resistant hash h:
		* Infeasible to find pair (x,x') s.t. $x'\neq x$ yet $h(x)$

### Hash functions
* Input m: (binary) strings
	* Keyed hash functions: also a (non-secret) key
* Output:
	* 'Short' (n-bit) binary strings
		* Sometimes called message digest
	* Keyed $h_k(m)$ or unkeyed $h(m)$

### Problem: secure distribution of large files
Example:
* Developer in LA develops large software $m$
* Repo in DC obtains copy of $m$
* User in NY wants to obtain $m$ securely and efficiently - How?
![[Screen Shot 2022-02-23 at 8.42.12 AM.png]]
Solution: hash allows security + efficiency
* Repo downloads software $m$ from developer
* Users download from (nearby) repo; receieves $m'$
	* Does $m'=m$? User should validate! How?
* User securely downloads $h(m)$ directly from developer
	* Digest $h(m)$ is short - much less overhead than downloading m
* User validates: $h(m) = h(m') => m = m'$
