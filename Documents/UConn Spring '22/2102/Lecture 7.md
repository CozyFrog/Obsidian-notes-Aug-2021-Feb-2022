## Core OO Concepts
### Class
* Static concept
* Definition of what a collection of objects might look like
* Defines the variables that are necessary to keep the state of the object
* Object is the thing that initializes variables

### Object
* Specific instance of a class.
* Dynamic concept

* OO paradigm: different objects have to interact with each other – how do they communicate w/ each other?
	* Passing messages by invoking each other's methods.
	* Message received by destination object, provides desired operation.

* Data container holds the collection of data managers. Example: holding all the cars in a dealership (all the ones on the lot or maybe all that have ever been sold).


## Answers to MCQ
* How many objects of a given class can there be in a program at one time?
	* No restrictions. As many as the application needs.
* Consider a system to manage the inventory in a car dealership. A "Car" class in this system is an example of:
	* Data manager class (X)
	* Data container class
	* Viewer/Interface class
	* Facilitator/Helper class
* Which programming paradigm uses classes?
	* Object oriented (X)
	* Procedural, classical, functional.

### Method
* Method is the executable portion of the class that executes the services that are defined in the interface of the class.
* Part of the class that is actually going to DO something. Going to change the states of the variables.
* Works with the data variables.
* Code is written in class file.


## Object Oriented vs Procedural
* Procedural: Top-down approach
	* Functional decomposition
* OO: Who is going to do what?
