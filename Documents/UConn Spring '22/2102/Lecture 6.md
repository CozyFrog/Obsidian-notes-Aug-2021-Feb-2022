* Suspend / resume tasks:
	* Should we allow for preemption?
	* Scheduling policy == round robin?

* Methods and signatures must be included in the interface for the client to be able to use it.

* Information hiding:
	* Client should be protected from anything that is likely to change in a module.
	* Should be protected against knowing/learning.
	* Hide implementation details.

* First steps:
	* Variables
	* Small computations to get to final answer
	* Humans naturally think top-down

* In practice, software design follows a yo-yo approach.
	* Top-down: starting at highest, most abstract definition of problem.
	* Bottom-up: identify very defined tasks, work from there.

* What else might be hidden in a module?
	* Any user interface libraries
	* Algorithms
