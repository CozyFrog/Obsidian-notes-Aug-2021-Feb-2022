## Pointer Usage
* What can you do?
	* Get the address of something
	* Dereference an address to get to something 
		* "Go and fetch what is at that address" or, alternatively, "go and write into the drawer that has that address and write a new value in there".
		* Dereferencing: basically following the pointers all the way through to wherever it points, going there, and reading or writing at that location.
