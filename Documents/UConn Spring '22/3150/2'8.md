Read a string from the console - is it or is it not a palindrome?

c implementation:
~~~
int main() {
	// initialize char array
	// take input from stdin
	// reallocate space for this char array
	// step through from front and back, comparing
		chars
}
~~~

Mark of a good programmer: appropriate laziness.

Iterators will read up to an empty space, so our palindrome program doesn't work with something like "tac o cat" but works with "tacocat".
