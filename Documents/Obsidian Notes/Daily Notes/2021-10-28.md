## Systems MT2 Study Outline
- Manual pages
- Practice
- Clear up lingering confusion
	- why do we not have to cast malloc? how does void\* work?
- Debugging mentality
	- What do I think my code is doing?
	- Step through (like really, step by step) and print EVERYTHING. Compare what I think is happening to what is actually happening. Why is it different? Go very slowly, this will save time.
- Writing process:
	- Read through problem statement, highlight key elements.
	- Extract functionality:
		- What do we have to do? What is the input? What is the output? Are we given hints to the tools we need?
	- What tools could we use?
	- Fully consider options before diving in to pseudocode.
	- Write pseudocode
		- including things like allocating, reallocating, freeing, closing, etc.
	- Translate pseudocode to C code
	- DEBUG
