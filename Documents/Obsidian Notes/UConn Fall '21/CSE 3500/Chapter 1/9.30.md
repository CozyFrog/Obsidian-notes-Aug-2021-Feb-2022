Data Structures

- Stack
	- LIFO
	- Use your own stack to put function calls, so it's sitting in memory instead of program stack
- Queue
	- FIFO
- Linked List
	- Abstraction of data in list format
- Heap
	- Find min or max fast
	- Can be used for priority queues
	- Heapsort
	- \# of nodes
		- min: $n^h$
		- max: $2^{h+1}-1$
	- in max heap, min value is at a leaf
	- Building a max heap runtime: O(nlog(n))
	- log(n) - runtime of operation, n operations
- Binary Search Tree
	- Most operations are done in O(h) time, where h is the height of the tree.
	- Represented with a root pointer, T.root, and each node contains a key and pointers to the left child, right child, and parent.
	- Print - O(n)
	- h = log(n)
	- next - find the leftmost descendant of the right child
		- if there's no right child, go up left until you go right
	- delete
		- no children, just delete
		- one child, swap
		- two children:
			- replace with leftmost right child, the next node
