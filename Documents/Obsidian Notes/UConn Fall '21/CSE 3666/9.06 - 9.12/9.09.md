Mask (AND) – If mask is 1, output is t1. if mask is 0, output is 0.

Mask (OR) – if mask is 0, get 0. if mask is 1, always get 1.

Mask (XOR) – if mask is 0, output is t1. if mask is 1, output is ~t1.

Not - all bits are 1 in the mask.

How to load 32 bit immediate?

LUI rd, immd
- LUI allows 20-bit immediate
	- Assembler supports %hi(C) to get the higher 20 bits of C
- The 20 bits are placed into bits 12 to bits 31
	- Lower 12 bits are cleared

- Load 0x12345678 into reg. s0
lui s0, 0x12345
addi s0, s0, 0x678

- Load 0x789ABCDE into reg. s0
lui s0, 0x789AB
addi s0, s0, 0xCDE
- error: interprets 0xCDE as unsigned
- addi s0, s0, 0xFFFFFCDE - have to add 1 to the 20 higher bits
Then
- lui s0, 0x789A*C* instead of 0x789A*B*
- addi s0, s0, 0xFFFFFCDE


s1 = s0 \*4 (four operations)
slli s1, s0, 2

s1 = s0 \* 128
slli s1, s0, 7

s1 = s0 \* 9
slli s1, s0, 3
add s1, s1, s0

s1 = s0 \* 7
slli s1, s0, 3
sub s1, s1, s0


s1 / 4
srli s1, 2

v = 0b 0100 1100
v % 4
check right 2 bits
andi - what mask? all 0s
v %8
check right 3 bits
when you shift right, the remainder are the bits that get shifted off

if s0 % 4 == 0 goto L4


addi t0, s0, 1
checking the rightmost bit
