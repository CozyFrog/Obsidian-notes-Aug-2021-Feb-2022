bits in t0 are all 1.

# Load 32-bit Constants
LUI loads 20-bit immediate into bits 31-12. Lower 12 bits are cleared
Be careful with sign extensions - anything "i" will extend the sign bit of the immediate.
In the case of addi after lui, if the immediate has a sign bit of 1 it will add -1 to the upper 20 bits. To offset, add one to the immediate that's being LUI'd.
