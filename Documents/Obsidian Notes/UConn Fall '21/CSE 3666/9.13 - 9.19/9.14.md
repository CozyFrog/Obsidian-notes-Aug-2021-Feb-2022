Memory
- array of bytes
- each byte is numbered
	- number is address
- each address identifies a byte
	- if a data item is larger than one byte, its addrress is the first byte in memory
- a 32-bit address space supports 4 GiB
	- exbibyte = $2^{60}$ bytes

Many ISAs cannot compute data in memory directly
- must load data into a register first

Two kinds of instructions to exchange data between registers and memory
- Load: memory to register
- Store: register to memory

Need to know the address to read/write memory
- You need an address to save/fetch items

$\\$

Load/Store instructions
// load a word from mem into rd
// Red\[rd\] = Mem\[Reg\[rs1\] + offset\}

lw		rd,		offset(rs1)

// save a word to mem
//Mem\[Reg\[rs1\] + offset\] = Reg\[rs1\]
s1		rs2,	offset(rs1)

- Load/store words
- Offset is also called displacement
- The address is the value in register plus the offset
	- address = Reg\[rs1\] + offset


Example
- Each row in the table is a word
	- The address is incremented by 4


s1: 0x00FE9010
copy value a -> b

lw t0, 0(s1) //0 offset
sw t0, 4(s1) //4 offset

$\\$

Array

h: s2
A's addr: s3

Pseudo:
load a(5) to t0
add t0 and s2
store t0 to a(20)

RISC-V:
lw		t0, 20\[s3\]
add		t1, t0, s2
sw		t1, 80\[s3\]


Clearing an array
Pseudo:
for (i=0; i<8; i=i+1)
a(i) = 0;

RISC-V:
addi	t0, x0, 0
addi	t1, x0, 8

loop:
		slli	t2, t0, 2
		add		t3, s1, t2
		sw		x0, 0(t3)
		addi	t0, t0, 1
		blt		t0, t1, loop
		
		
Copying an Array
addi	t0, x0, 100

loop:
		slli	t1, s1, 2
		add		t2, s2, t1 //get address of a(i)
		add		t3, s3, t1 //get address of b(i)
		lw		t4, 0(t2)  //load value at a(i) into t4
		sw		t4, 0(t3)
		addi	s1, s1, 1
		blt		s1, t0, loop
		
$\\$

LA (load address) is a pseudoinstruction

$\\$

Alignment: Data item's address is a multiple of its size
- address of words is a multiple of 4 (because a word has 4 bytes)
- Address of half words is a multiple of 2

Data addresses do not have to be aligned in RISC-V, but misalignment will cause poor performance
- Addresses must be aligned in this course!

Question

lw		t0, 0x200(x0)

first byte is 0xAC, next is 0x81, 0x65, 0x32

so t0 = 0x3265 81AC
