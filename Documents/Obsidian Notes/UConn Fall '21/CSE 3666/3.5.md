## Pipeline Control Hazards
- When the flow of instruction is not sequential (i.e. the next instruction is not located at PC+4), the processor has to wait for PC.
	- Dependence through PC: PC is needed in IF, but produced in later stages.
- Due to changes of instruction flow:
	- Branches
	- Jumps
	- Exceptions

- BEQ is resolved in MEM. The correct instruction is fetched when it is in WB.

- Two types of Stalls:
	- NOP (or bubble) is inserted between two instructions in the pipeline (as done for load-use situations).
		- Keep the instructions in earlier stages of the pipeline (later in the code) from progressing down the pipeline for a cycle.
		- Insert NOP by zeroing control bits in the pipeline register at the appropriate stage.
		- Let the instructions in later stages of the pipeline (earlier in the code) progress normally down the pipeline.
	- Flushes are that one or more instructions are replaced with NOPs.
		- Zero the control bits for the instruction to be flushed.
		- NOP, instead of instruction from I-Mem, is stored in IF/ID.

## Static Branch Prediction
- Predict Not Taken.
	- Continue to fetch sequential instr. stream.
	- If prediction is correct, keep the instructions.
	- If the prediction is wrong, 3 instructions are flushed (3 stall cycles).

## Dynamic Branch Prediction
- Uses the history of a branch to predict its next outcome.
- Buffer / table keeps history for branches (BHT).
- 1-bit, 2-bit predictors.
