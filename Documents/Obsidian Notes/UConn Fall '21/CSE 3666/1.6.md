# Instruction Encoding

- RISC-V base ISA are encoded as 32-bit instruction words
- Both instructions and data are stored in memory
- Program Counter (PC) points to the current instruction
	- incremented by 4 in normal flow for sequential instruction

- R-Format: instructions using 3 register inputs
	- add, xor, sub		- arithmetic/logical ops
- I-Format: instructions with immediates, loads
	- addi, lw, jalr, slli
- S-Format: store instructions
	- sw, sb
- SB-Format: branch instructions:
	- beq, bge, blt
- U-Format: instructions with upper immediates
	- lui, auipc		- upper immediate is 20 bits
- UJ-Format: jump instructions
	- jal
