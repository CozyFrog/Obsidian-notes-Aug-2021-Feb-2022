# Functions
- Function basics
	- Write a function
	- Call a function
	- Calling convention
- Using stack to save/restore data

$\\$

# Flow with functions
- Upon function call, processor starts to execute instructions in function
- Processor resumes from the instruction that follows the function call

$\\$

# jal
- jal $\quad$ rd, label (<- indicates mem. addr.)
- Jump And Link
	- go to the label
	- save the address of the following instruction (PC+4) in rd
- rd is the return address

# jalr
- jalr $\quad$ rd, offset(rs1)
- go to an address stored in rs1 plus an offset
- saves the address of the following instruction(PC+4) in rd
- return means " jump to the return address saved in a register"

$\\$

# Passing Params, Returning Values
- First 8 params/args are passed to the function in
	- a0, a1, ..., a7
- Two values can be returned in
	- a0, a1

$\\$

# Stack
- Stack grows from higher address toward lower address
	- sp is the address of the word at the TOP of the stack (the bottom of the stack is at the top of the address space)
- Two operations:
	- push adds data to the top
	- pop removes data from the top
- Can be used for:
	- Saving registers
	- Keeping local variables
	- Passing args
	- Returning values
Push s1, s2, s3 onto the stack:
addi sp, sp, -12
sw s1, 8(sp)
sw s2, 4(sp)
sw s3, 0(sp)
Pop:
lw s1, 8(sp)
lw s2, 4(sp)
lw s3, 0(sp)
addi sp, sp, 12 # restore sp after loads
