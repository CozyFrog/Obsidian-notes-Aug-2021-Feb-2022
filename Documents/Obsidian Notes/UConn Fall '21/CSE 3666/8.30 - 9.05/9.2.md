Can't save anything in register 0
Registers have names
We're going to use these: (t: temporary, s: save)
- 5
	- t0
- 6
	- t1
- 7
	- t2
- 8
	- s0/fp
- 9
	- s1
- 18-27
	- s2 - s11
- 28-31
	- t3-t6


# Arithmetic Operations
- Add and subtract
	- Three operands and all operands are registers
	- Two sources and one destination. The 1<sup>st</sup> operand is the destination
		- ```add x1, x2, x3``` # x1 = x2 + x3
		- ```sub x1, x2, x3``` # x1 = x2 - x3
- All arithmetic operations have this form
- <mark>Design Principle 1: Simplicity favors regularity</mark>
	- Regularity makes implementation simpler
	- Simplicity enables higher performance at lower cost

ex. 1:
a = b + c;
d = a - e;
Assume


| Variable	| Register |
| --------- | -------- |
| a	| s1 |
| b | s2 |
| c | s3 |
| d | s4 |
| e | s5 |


a = b + c; ```add s1, s2, s3```

f = (g + h) - (i + j);

| Variable	| Register |
| --------- | -------- |
| f	| s0 |
| g | s1 |
| h | s2 |
| i | s3 |
| j | s4 |
| g+h | t0 |
| i+j | t1 |

```add t0, s1, s2``` ```add t1, s3, s4```
```sub s0, t0, t1```

set t0 to 0: ```sub t0, t0, t0```

Always some value in the registers, not null


- How do we count?
	- ```t0 = t0 + 1```

# Immediate Operands
- Constant data can be specified in some instructions
	- ```addi s3, s3, 4``` # increment s3 by 4
	- No subtract immediate instruction
		- Just use a negative constant
		- ```addi s2, s1, -1``` # s2 = s1 - 1
- The immediate must be in the range \[-2048, 2047\]
- <mark>Design Principle 3:</mark> Make the common case fast
	- Small constants are common

# The Constant Zero
- Register 0 (zero) is the constant 0
	- Cannot be overwritten
	- If you need 0, it is already in x0. No need to use another register
- Useful for common operations
	- Move value between registers
		- ```add t2, s1, zero```
- Load an immediate into a register
	- ```addi t2, x0, 100```
	- ```addi t2, x0, -20```

Question:
- How do we calculate the absolute value of an integer?
- How do we calculate the sum of integers from 0 to 99?

The execution of instructions is normally sequential.
How does a processor support selection and repitition?

# Branches
- Conditional branches
	- If a condition is true, go to the instruction indicated by the label
	- Otherwise, continue sequentially
		- No less than or equal to or greater than
		- ```beq rs1, rs2, L1``` # if (rs1 == rs2) goto L1
		- ```bne rs1, rs2, L2``` # if (rs1 != rs2) goto L2
		- ```blt rs1, rs2, L3``` # if (rs1 < rs2) goto L3
		- ```bge rs1, rs2, L4``` # if (rs1 >= rs2) goto L4
\# example of a label
L1: 	ADD x1, x2, x3

Branches compare ```two registers```! Not with an immediate


# If Statements
&emsp;if (i == j) {
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;f = g + h
&emsp;&emsp;}

Pseudocode
if (i != j) goto Skip
f = g + h
Skip: # this is a label

| Variable	| Register |

# While Loop
while (cond) {
	statements
}

\# Method 1
Loop:
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; if (! cond) goto Exit # executed every loop
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Statements
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; goto Loop # executed every loop
Exit:

\# Method 2
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; goto Test # executed once
Loop:
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Test:
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; if (cond) goto Loop # executed every loop

Question
Implement the following loop with RISC-V instructions
sum = 0;
i = 0;
while (i < 100) {
&emsp;&emsp;sum i += 1;
&emsp;&emsp;i += 1;
}

| Variable	| Register |
| --------- | -------- |
| i	| s0 |
| sum | s1 |
| end | s2 |

RISC-V
addi s0, x0, 0&emsp;&emsp; ```#executed once```
addi s1, x0, 0&emsp;&emsp; ```#executed once```
addi s2, x0, 100&emsp;```#executed once```

>Pseudocode
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;i = 0
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;sum = 0

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;goto test

beq&emsp;x0, x0, test&emsp; ```#executed once```
loop:
&emsp;&emsp; add&emsp;s1, s1, s0&emsp;```executed 100 times```
&emsp;&emsp; addi&emsp;s0, s0, 1&emsp;```executed 100 times```
Test:
&emsp;&emsp; blt&emsp;i, s2, loop&emsp;```executed 101 times```

# Design Question
- Can beq, bne, blt, bge compare values in all the ways we need?
- How do we do the following in RISC-V?
	- ```if s1 <= s2 goto L1``` -> ```if s2 >= s1 goto L1```
- Switch them
