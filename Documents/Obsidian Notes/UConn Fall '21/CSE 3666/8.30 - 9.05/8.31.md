Below the program:
Applications software > Systems software > Hardware

Applications:
- High-Level-Language
Systems:
- Compiler: translates HLL to machine code
- OS: Scheduling tasks & Sharing resources
Hardware:
- Processor, memory, I/O controllers

Abstraction between layers

High-level language
- Level of abstraction closer to problem domain
- Provides for productivity and portability
- Converted to assembly language by *compiler*

Assembly Language
- Textual representation of instructions
- Converted to machine code by *assembler*

Machine Code
- Representation stored in hardware
- Instructions and data are encoded with bits


*Instruction* - a basic operation that software can perform on processor


*Seven Great Ideas/Design Principles*
- Use abstraction to simplify design
- Make the common case fast
	- Cannot take care of everything. What are the most common operations? Make *them* fast
- Performance via parallelism
	- Multiple actors doing work, work is done faster
- Performance via pipelining
- Performance via prediction
- Hierarchy of memories
- Dependability via redundancy
(Read section 1.2)

*ISA*
Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
- Defines the instruction set a processor understands
- Provides a level of abstraction for the hardware and software
	- It is the interface between the software that runs on a computer and the hardware that executes it

Hierarchy: 
- Applications
- OS
- ISA
- Machine Organization
- Circuit design
- Device technology

*Family of ISAs*
- A family of microprocessors understands the same instructions
	- Programs can run on different processors
- e.g. x86, ARM, AMD64, PowerPC, MIPS, RISC-V


*RISC-V*
- Can be used on 31-bit, 64-bit, 128-bit microcontrollers/supercomputers
- Going to use RV321 (Basic Integer Instruction Set, 32-bit)
- Extensions
	- M, Standard Extension for Integer Multiplication and Division
	- F/D, Standard Extension for floating-point operations


*Computer Program*
Program = Data + Algorithm
Always know where your data are and how to access them

Storing Data in a Computer
- Register file
	- A set of general purpose registers
		- Integers, addresses, chars, etc.
		- Programmers know the type
	- A register is a circuit that can store data
- Memory <- RAM
	- Another place where data can be stored
	- View it as an array of bytes

Register File is faster, but much smaller than memory
DP 2: Smaller is faster
	Accessing register file is much faster than accessing memory
	
	
Register file in RISC-V has 32 registers
- Numbered from 0 to 31
- Each register has 32 bits (as we are using RV321)
	- A 32-bit data item is called a *word*
- We use registers to keep frequently accessed data because they are *fast*
