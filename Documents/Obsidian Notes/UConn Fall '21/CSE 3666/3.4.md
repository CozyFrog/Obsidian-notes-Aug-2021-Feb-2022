## Pipeline Hazards
- Structural Hazards: attempt to use the same resource by two different instructions at the same time.
- Data Hazards: attempt to use data before it is ready.
	- An instruction's source operand(s) are produced by a prior instruction still in the pipeline.
- Control Hazards: attempt to make a decision about program control flow before the condition has been evaluated and the new PC target address calculated.
	- Branch and jump instructions, exceptions.

- Pipeline Registers:
	- ID/EX
	- EX/MEM
	- MEM/WB

## Data Hazards
- Data dependency may cause data hazard.
	- Data Dependency: an instruction depends on data produced by a previous instruction.
	- Data Hazard: an instruction cannot get its data in time.

- Forwarding
	- Fix data hazards by forwarding results from where they are available to where they are needed.
	- Take data where it is available in any of the pipeline registers and forward it to the units that need it.
	- For ALU: the inputs can come from any pipeline register rather than just from ID/EX.

- MEM/WB to MEM forwarding:
	- Loads that are immediately followed by stores (memory-to-memory copies) can avoid stall via forwarding

- Insert a NOP for every dash in the pipeline diagram.
- Every cycle with one or more dashes is a stall cycle.
