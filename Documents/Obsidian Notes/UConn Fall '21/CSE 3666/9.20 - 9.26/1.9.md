# PC-Relative Addressing
Add a 32-bit offset to PC to access data near the instruction.
Benefit: Data and code can be moved together.

# AUIPC
```AUIPC	rd, immd	#rd = PC + UI```
(Add Upper Immediate to PC)
- Operations:
	- Obtain an immediate like LUI. The higher 20 bits plus 12 0s.
	- Add the immediate and PC (PC-relative addressing).
