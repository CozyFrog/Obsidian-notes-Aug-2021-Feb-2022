## Metrics to compare comp. perf.
- Response Time
	- How long it takes to complete a task.
- Throughput
	- Total work done per unit time, e.g. tasks/transactions... per hour.
- Rates
	- MFLOPS (million floating-point ops / sec)
	- MIPS (million instructions / sec)

- CPU Execution Time
	- Time processor needs to process given job

### CPU Clocking
- Clock Period (<u>cycle time</u>): duration of a clock cycle (units in seconds).
- Clock Frequency (<u>rate</u>): cycles per second (units in hertz).

### CPU Time
CPU Time = Clock Cycles $\cdot$ Clock Cycle Time.
Perfomance is improved by reducing \# of cycles, increasing rate.

### Performance
$\text{Performance}=\frac1{\text{CPU Time}}$.
Comparing performance:
"X is <u>n times</u> faster than Y":
$n=\frac{\text{Performance}_x}{\text{Performance}_y}=\frac{\text{Execution}_y}{\text{Execution}_x}$

### CPI
$CPI=\frac{\text{Clock Cycles}}{\text{Instruction Count}}$
CPI also equals the sum of the clock cycles that class i instructions take times the frequency of class i instructions for all instructions.

CPU Time = Instruction Count x CPI x Clock Cycle Time.

### Speedup
"Using a new method, x% of an application can execute k times faster. What is the overall speedup of the new method on the application?"
$$\text{Speedup}=\frac1{(1-x)+\frac{x}{k}}$$
