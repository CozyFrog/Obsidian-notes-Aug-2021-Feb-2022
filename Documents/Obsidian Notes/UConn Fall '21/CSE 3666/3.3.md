## Pipelined Datapath
- Add pipeline registers between pipeline stages to isolate them.
	- Data stored in registers are stable for the cycle.
	- Info needed in later stages are saved in pipeline registers.
- Control signals are generated in ID and passed to later stages.
- Do writes in the first half of the cycle and reads in the second half.
	- Could therefore have WB and ID in the same cycle.

## Structural Hazards
- Dealing with structural hazards:
	- Add more resources, or
	- Share resources
- Memory:
	- Add more resources: instruction memory and data memory.
- Register:
	- Share resources: write in the first half of a cycle and read in the second.
