	# Address Alignment
- Addresses of words must be a multiple of 4
- Addresses of half-words must be a multiple of 2
- Data does not have to be aligned, but instructions do


$\\$

# Offset in Branches
- Offset is stores in the 12 bits of the instruction. The offset is the distance between the target address and PC.
- branch offset = target address - PC
- offset is always even

# JALR
JALR writes PC+4 to rd, sets PC = rs1 + imm.
