A random variable X is a function X: S->R.

# PMF
<u>Def</u> The pmf (probability mass function) of X is defined by
$$p(x)=P(X=x)=P(\{w\in S:X(w)=x\}).$$

$\\$

# CDF
$$F(x)=P(X\leq x).$$

$\\$

# Expected Value
<u>Def</u> The expected value of X, or mean of X, is defined to be
$$E(X)=\sum_xx\;p(x).$$
where $p(x)=P(X=x)$ is the pmf.

$\\$

# Variance
<u>Def</u> The variance of X is defined to be
$$Var(X)=E(X^2)-E(X)^2$$

$\\$

# STDev
<u>Def</u> The standard deviation is defined to be
$$\delta (X)=\sqrt{Var(X)}$$
