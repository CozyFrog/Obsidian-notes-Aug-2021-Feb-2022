Quiz every tuesday (first is 9/28) except for first day and 10/19.

Second exam is not cumulative.

Exams during class time. May use tablet for homework, exam.

Weekly quizzes are written, long form. Better to write more than less – explain very carefully and thoroughly. About 2 questions.

No homework! To prepare for quizzes solve all exercises in textbook. Find more problems from the reference book.

\* Why do we study probability?
1. Crucial in decisionmaking. In order to make a decision, we need to know what is more/less likely.
2. Language – describing phenomena.


*Chapter 1*
- Roll a die – what is the probability of getting an odd number?
	- 3/6 = 1/2 = 50%
- We need to count! The theory of counting is called *Combinatorics*

\* The multiplication rule
	Suppose that
	1. m experiments are performed in order
	2. the *k*th experiment has n<sub>k</sub> possible outcomes
	
The total # of outcomes is 
	n<sub>1</sub>  - n<sub>2</sub> - n<sub>3</sub> --- n<sub>m</sub>
	
<u>e.g.</u> How many ways can 5 people stand in line? 5!
\<sol\> 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 5! = *120*
`ALWAYS find the final number for full credit`

\* Permutations
	Assume there are n distince objects. How many different ordered arrangements of the objects are possible?
	``` ```
	n x (n-1) x ... x 2 x 1 = n!
	``` ```
	Each arrangement is called a permutation. Thus, the total # of permutations of n objects is n!.

<u>e.g.</u> 
1. 10 books are going to be put on a bookshelf. How many arrangements are possible?
\<sol\> 10! = 3,628,800

2. 4 of the 10 books are math books, 3 of them are chemistry books, and 3 are history books. If all the books of the same subject are put together, how many arrangements are possible?
\<sol\> *3!* x <u>3! x 3! x 4!</u>
*permutation of the subjects*
<u>permutation within the subjects</u>

3. How many different letter arrangements can be formed from the letters of the word Mississippi?
\<sol\>
	Consider ABB. If b1 and b2 are different, 3! = 6.
	If they are the same, 3 = 3! / 2! (because there are 2 redundant ways of counting)
	``` ```
	11! = 39916800.
	M : 1
	I : 4
	S : 4
	P : 2
	``` ```
	11! / 4! x 4! x 2! x 1! = 34,650

\* <u>Permutations with Identical Objects</u>
Assume there are n objects of which n<sub>1</sub> are alike, n<sub>2</sub> are alike, ..., n<sub>r</sub> are alike. Then there are
<mark>n! / (n<sub>1</sub>! n<sub>2</sub>! ... n<sub>r</sub>!)*</mark>

different arrangements of n objects
	
	
<u>e.g.</u> A house has 12 rooms. We want to paint 4 of them yellow, 3 purple, and 5 red. In how many ways can this be done?
\<sol\> $\frac{12!}{4!3!5!}$ = 27720

\* <u>Combinations</u>
<u>e.g.</u> Twelve people belong to a club. How many ways can they pick a president, a vice president, a secretary, and a treasurer?
\<sol\> Use the multiplication rule.
<center>P V S T<br>
12 x 11 x 10 x 9 = 11880</center>

In general, n club members, k offices.
How many ways of electing the officer?
<sub>n</sub>P<sub>k</sub> = n(n-1) ... (n - k + 1) = 
$\frac{n(n-1)...2*1}{(n-k)(n-k-1)...2*1}$ = <mark>$\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$</mark>

<center>Thus <sub>n</sub>P<sub>k</sub> = $\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$ <br>
the # of permutations of k objects from a set of size n</center>
	
<u>e.g.</u> 12 club members. How many ways can they pick 4 people to be on a committee?
\<sol\> Let <sub>12</sub>C<sub>4</sub> be the # of ways of choosing 4 people. Then<br>
<sub>12</sub>C<sub>4</sub> x 4! = <sub>12</sub>P<sub>4</sub></br>
<sub>12</sub>C<sub>4</sub> = <sub>12</sub>P<sub>4</sub> / 4! = 
$\frac{12!}{(12-4)!}$ = $\frac{12*11*10*9}{4*3*2*1}$ = 495

In general, n club members, k people on a committee
<sub>n</sub>C<sub>k</sub> = # of ways of choosing k people from n people
<sub>n</sub>P<sub>k</sub> = no distinct positions, so <sub>n</sub>C<sub>k</sub> * k!*

<sub>n</sub>C<sub>k</sub> = nPk / k! = n!/k!(n-k)!

<sub>n</sub>C<sub>k</sub> is called the # of <u>combinations</u> of k objects from a set of size n.

This formula is VERY important!

We also write
<sub>n</sub>C<sub>k</sub> = (n, k) –> "n choose k"

<u>e.g.</u>
1. 12 friends	7 to a party. How many choices are possible?
	\<sol\> 12 choose 7 = $\frac{12*11*10*9*8*7*6}{7*6*5*4*3*2*1}$ = 792
2. How many if Al and Bob will not both go to the party?
3. \<sol\>
	1. al goes ~ <sub>10</sub>C<sub>6</sub> = 210
	2. bob goes ~ <sub>10</sub>C<sub>6</sub> = 210
	3. neither  ~ <sub>10</sub>C<sub>7</sub> = 120
	4. both ~  ~ <sub>10</sub>C<sub>5</sub> = 252

Add cases together, as they are discrete (not a multiplication rule).
1. \+ 2. + 3. = 540
