C Primer

What you need:
- Compiler
	- GCC – invoked with the command CC
- Linker
	- also GCC
	- different role


C in context
- created to implement UNIX
	- UNIX is a pun on MULTIX ('u' for unique, ironic)
Design principles
- manual memory management
- REALLY fast

Paradigm
- purely procedural language – no OO whatsoever


Objective-C, C++, C# are all based on C. Java takes parts of C.

"./" tells that the program is in the current directory. ./ is the name of the current directory


 arguments of main – historically, argc and argv
 - argc: argument counter, the number of arguments being passed on the command line to the program
 - argv: an array of strings that correspond to every single argument that is being passed DOWN to your program
