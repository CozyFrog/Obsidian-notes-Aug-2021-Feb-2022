Basic Data Types
- A few integer types
	- char
	- short
	- int
	- long
	- long long
- Character types
	- Chars are 8-bit wide
	- Typical use ASCII code
	- Every int in 0..127
		- Yields a "symbol"
- Characters in 0..31 range
	- Non printable character, aka "control"
		- like '\n', '\r', etc.
	- '8' - '0' turns into 56 - 48 = 8. Way to turn ASCII chars into integers
- Booleans
	- No booleans in C!
	- 0 always means FALSE, anything non-zero is TRUE
- Use two macros to define TRUE and FALSE
