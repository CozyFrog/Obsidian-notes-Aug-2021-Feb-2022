"./" tells that the program is in the current directory. ./ is the name of the current directory


 arguments of main â€“ historically, argc and argv
 - argc: argument counter, the number of arguments being passed on the command line to the program
 - argv: an array of strings that correspond to every single argument that is being passed DOWN to your program


*why is configuring the path to not use ./ considered a security risk?*

K&R is VERY permissive, but you have no guarantee as to what it will do

Everybody follows the C99 standard

#include "imports" a header file with the specification of utility functions that exist in a library to be linked with the program

Why do we always have to return something?
	- When the process dies it must tell the O.S. how things went - this is a way to report back. Returning a status of 0 means everything went fine.
	
What is cc doing?
- Preprocesses hello.c
- compiles hello.c to hello.o
- links hello.o with libc
- writes executable fine a.out
