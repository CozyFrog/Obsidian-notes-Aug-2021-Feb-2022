Floating points
- Consider x86_64 again
- 32 bit float
- 64 bit double
- 80/128 bit long double

Type Casting
- Useful to convert an operand to another type before arithmetic
- ('Type')'expression'
- Casting is highest precidence

Are your operands signed or unsigned?
What is the size (in bit) of each operand?
When doing arithmetic
- C will convert the second operand to the type of the first
- C may truncate results if the type of assignee is smaller than the type of the result (and the result cannot be represented)

Q: What would the unsigned representation of -4 be? 2's complement
