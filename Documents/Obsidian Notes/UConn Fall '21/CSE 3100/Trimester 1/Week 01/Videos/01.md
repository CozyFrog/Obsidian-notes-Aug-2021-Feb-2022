Learning Objectives
- Develop necessary system skills to be able to write software that's high-performance and can run on a variety of hardware.

Critical to develop programming skills that are relevant in the context of multi-core machines because most machines today are multi-core.

- Three parts:
	- C Programming
	- Concurrent programming at the level of inter-process communication (how do processes talk to one another in order to do a variety of things like FTP, SMTP, HTTP – all require inter-process communication)
	- Intra-process communication – within a process how do you make use of multiple cores at the same time?


System Skills
- C is a compiled language. It is much closer to the operating system / to the machine. It develops very efficient code.
	- Manual memory management
	- Pointers!! 


Why C?
C is
- Simple
- Small
- Very popular
- FAST

Multi-core platforms
- All of your machines are multi-core
- CPU - multiple cores
- GPU - thousands of cores


Expectations: Learned Outcomes

	- UNIX APIs
		- Pipes
		- Sockets
		- Shared memory
- Intra-process concurrency
	- POSIX threading model
	- Synchronization
