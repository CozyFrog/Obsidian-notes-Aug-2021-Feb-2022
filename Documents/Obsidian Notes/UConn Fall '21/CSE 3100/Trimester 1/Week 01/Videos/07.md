Expressions in C are very similar to Java, C++, Python
Inductively defined
- Leaves
	- Constants
	- Local variables
	- Arrays
- Internal nodes
	- For pretty much everything else (operators, field access,...)

Constants
- Cannot name them

Local Variables
- Local variables have types
- Declared inside a funtion (99% of the time)

Assignment
- LHS
	- something that can be written to
- Expression (RHS)
	- Based on arithmetic operators, array access, pointer manipulations


Critical Observation
- For expressions and assignments
	- Everything has a TYPE
	- The LHS
	- The Expression
	- Every "node" inside the expression
- C checks that the assignment makes sense
	- Type of LHS is compatible with type of Expression


Assignments ARE NOT Statements
- Assignments are expressions
	- You can chain them!
		- Ex. a = b = c = 10;
			- a = (b = (c = 20));

Operator precedence
