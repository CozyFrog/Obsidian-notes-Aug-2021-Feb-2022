Switch
switch(expression) {
- case label<sub>0</sub>: \<block<sub>0</sub>\>
	case label<sub>1</sub>: \<block<sub>1</sub>\>
	...
	default: \<block<sub>0</sub>\> "this is the fallback
}

When you come out of block<sub>0</sub>, you go into block<sub>1</sub> (next block!)

Have to add a ```break;``` if you want to get out of block

The dangerous ones
- Two control primitives
	- Break - gets out of switch and loop (should only use with switch, really)
		- can appear in a nested if / then / else
		- always refers to the enclosing loop (the innermost loop)
	- Continue - should only use with loops - skips the rest of *this* iteration and goes back to the next iteration if there is another iteration

Q: How do you take input in the form of a string through scanf();?
