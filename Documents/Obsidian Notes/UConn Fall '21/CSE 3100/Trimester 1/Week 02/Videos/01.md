*Control Flow*

All 
- blocks
- for
- while
- if-then-else
- switch
- break
- continue

Control: All about deciding what the next instruction the program will do. Might want to alter flow
Control is about
- Evaluating "boolean" conditions to alter the flow of the program

Corollary for C
- Since any integer is a boolean
- Unlike Java, you can use ints to control flow

*Blocks*
- Purpose: group statements together
	- Contain semicolon separated list of statements
	- Useful for loops / branching / switches
- Also called "compound statements"
- Curly braces to define

*For Loop*
- Called a "bounded" or "counting" loop
- Syntax
	- ```for(<expression> ; <expression> ; <expression <stmt>```
	- 1: Initializing the loop
		- init can contain a declaration!
	- 2: Deciding whether or not to continue
	- 3: To go to the next iteration
ex.
- "counting" in c
	```for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) <stmt>```
- "counting" in Python
	```for i in range(0, 10): <stmt>```
