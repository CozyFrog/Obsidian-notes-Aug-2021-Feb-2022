Memory Organization
- Memory
	- Every *Process* has an
		- <mark>Address Space</mark>
	-	They all believe they have access to all of the memory

- Address Space
	-	Executable code is at the bottom
	-	Above that is the static area
		-	Contains all static variables
	- Stack is at the top (going down!)
	- Heap grows from the bottom (doing up!)
		- Above the static area
	- The area between the Stack and Heap is HUGE

When you write C programs, your memory always comes from one of these three places:
- Static
	- Static variables
- Stack
	- Arguments passed to a function
	- Local variable inside a function
- Heap (Manually Managed)
	- Dynamic memory allocation
