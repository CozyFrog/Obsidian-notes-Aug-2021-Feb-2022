Functions

Fundamental Language tool to build procedural abstractions
A black box:
- SPECIFIES what the computation will do
- ABSTRACTS AWAY how the computational process works
- it takes INPUT
- it produces an OUTPUT

Idealized View: only design functions where behavior depends SOLELY on the input arguments.

- Nice functions <mark>only</mark> depends on their inputs
	- No side-effects
	- No globals/statics
	- Small and manageable
- Usually two steps
	- Declare the function "prototype"
		- Declaration of what the function is
	- Define the function
		- How does it do its job?

Can define after main()


```while(n-)```
Post decrement: n is looked up – if it is not 0, another iteration is performed.
after this iteration, it is then decremented.

```while(--n)```
Pre decrement: n is decremented, then used

Avoid static, avoid globals
Every single time a function depends on something, that thing <mark>should be an argument</mark>
